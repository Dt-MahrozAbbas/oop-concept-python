## üìò OOP Concepts in Python (Beginner Friendly)

This project demonstrates the **6 core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python through real-world inspired examples.

### ‚úÖ Covered Concepts

| Concept           | Description                                                                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Encapsulation** | Protects data by restricting access using private members.                           |
| **Abstraction**   | Hides complex details and shows only the necessary parts using abstract classes.     |
| **Inheritance**   | Allows a class to use properties and methods of another class.                       |
| **Polymorphism**  | Objects behave differently for the same method name (`speak()` example).             |
| **Composition**   | Strong `has-a` relationship; one class owns another (e.g. Car owns Engine).          |
| **Aggregation**   | Weak `has-a` relationship; one class uses another (e.g. University has Departments). |

### üß† Simple Real-Life Examples

* **Student class** wraps data using private variables ‚Üí **Encapsulation**
* **Dog makes sound** using abstract class ‚Üí **Abstraction**
* **Teacher inherits Person** ‚Üí **Inheritance**
* **Bird and Cat both speak differently** ‚Üí **Polymorphism**
* **Car owns Engine** and calls its function ‚Üí **Composition**
* **University uses independent Departments** ‚Üí **Aggregation**

```
--- Encapsulation ---
Name: Ali, Age: 21

--- Abstraction ---
Woof!

--- Inheritance ---

I teach students.

Chirp!
Meow!

--- Composition ---
Engine started.
